The purpose of this program is to serve as a simple chat bot that mimics a psychotherapist.

The program is seperated into header, implementation, and driver files and is comprised of one main class, Eliza.
The Eliza class contains vectors to store keywords and responses, as well as a set of noise (undesireable) words.
The constructor reads keywords and responses from an external file to populate the vectors.

The driver takes in user input, tokenizes it, and utilizes an Eliza object to search through a list of keywords,
trying to find a match for each token, where "noise" words are discarded. If a match is found, the index of the keyword is used to pull a corresponding
response from the response vector. The program continues prompting the user for input and displaying responses until
the user types "bye"

Multiple responses per category are available, and so a random one is chosen each time to add variety.

Additionally, some responses (that contain an *) are able to splice user input after the keyword to concatenate to the
end of the response.

In addition to basic responses, Eliza can also tell jokes and display haikus when prompted.
